# OW Version File. This file specifies the version. The line VERSION=X.Y.Z is
# used and parsed. This file has to be here everytime. The VERSION needs to be
# set properly or CMake will fail.
#
# SYNTAX: The version string always is 1.2.3 with an optional postfix of "+hg1234".
#         This is useful if building is done by scripts. If you want to automatically
#         add the correct HG revision, use only +hgX without number.
#
# IMPORTANT: If you modify the file, cmake re-creates the version header. But
#            it is not able to set all library version. Please re-run cmake if
#            you change something here.
#
# NOTE: do not add a space after #. The current CMake script will fail.
# Examples:
#VERSION=1.2.0
#VERSION=1.2.0+hgX  -> replaces the X with the current revision number
#VERSUIB=1.2.0+hg1234 -> here, revision number was set by the build scripts for example.
VERSION=0.0.1+hgX

This code was written by Daniel Dunbar, producing PoissonDisk Sampling. It is
taken from: https://github.com/ddunbar/PDSample. We copied code only partially
as we do not need the whole software. The software is orignially licensed this
way:

    This code is released into the public domain. You can do whatever
    you want with it.

    I do ask that you respect the authorship and credit myself (Daniel
    Dunbar) when referencing the code. Additionally, if you use the
    code in an interesting or integral manner I would like to hear
    about it.

So we think this compatible with LGPL. If not please contact us at:
math{at}informatiki{dot}uni{dash}leipzig{dot}de.

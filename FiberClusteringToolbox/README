* This is an example of how to create your own module toolbox
  for OpenWalnut (http://www.openwalnut.org).

* You should have a look at our WIKI for further details under
  http://www.openwalnut.org/projects/openwalnut/wiki/Module_ExternalDevelopment

* It basically creates one library with two modules in it.
  You can use this example as your basic development setup
  and extend it as you need.

* Please contact us if you have trouble or if you have added
  platform support to the OpenWalnut.cmake script. We 
  appreciate your help!


Happy coding!
